## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-14

### Added
- Initial release of streaming pattern matching optimization
- Naive and KMP algorithm implementations for streaming data
- Comprehensive performance benchmarking suite
- Network flow anomaly detection application
- 40+ visualization charts and analysis tools
- Professional README with detailed documentation
- Requirements.txt for easy setup
- MIT License
- Contributing guidelines

### Features
- Streaming implementation of pattern matching algorithms
- Character-by-character processing with deque-based sliding window
- Performance metrics tracking (execution time, comparisons, memory)
- Real-time network flow analysis for cybersecurity applications
- Data augmentation and preprocessing pipeline
- Comprehensive visualization suite (bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, violin plots)

### Performance
- KMP achieves 3.7x to 10.1x speedup over Naive algorithm
- 50-80% reduction in character comparisons
- Successfully processes datasets from 10KB to 50MB+
- Memory-efficient streaming approach

### Dataset
- Stanford University network security dataset (cs448b_ipasn.csv)
- 21K rows covering 3-month period (2006-07 to 2006-09)
- 5 compromised IPs identified through pattern analysis
- Pre-compromise pattern extraction and analysis
